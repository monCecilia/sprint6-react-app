# sprint6-react-app

## Description
In this task we will put into practice the basics learned from React.

We will start by creating a reacted website from scratch, including all the necessary steps, to then go on to create our first components and make use of props.

### Level 1
#### Ex 1
Installation and correct operation of the app.
#### Ex 2
Create a component and import it into the main App component.

### Level 2

Instead of encoding (typing directly) the value of the component inside, we will pass it as close from the App component.

### Level 3

We will read the books that our application will show from a JSON file. Therefore, we will import this file into our application and go through it with a .map structure.
